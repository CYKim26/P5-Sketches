# **P5 Sketch Reflection**
I drew a plant pot for my P5 sketch. My sketch was programmed with variables that I set up so that it could be parametric. This made the process of determining/calculating the coordinates and sizes of my 2D primitives easier becauses they were defined in reference to each other and not arbitrarily. This did, however, make the process more challenging in the sense that I had to deeply understand and be sure of my geometry because I could no longer define my shapes with values that only appeared to be correct. On another note, this project allowed me to understand that the order of my code is very important and, for example, that I had to redefine the colors of my shapes after I had previously changed them for another shape.
